# Robot Vacuum Simulator

## Brief Overview

Welcome to our **Robot Vacuum Simulator**, a playful and educational project that lets you explore the world of robot vacuum cleaners in a virtual setting. This project is made using React and Next.js, which means it's easy to use and customize.

Here's the deal: in this simulation, you get to watch how a robot vacuum moves around and cleans a space. Think of the space as a big grid, and each robot vacuum takes care of one grid square at a time. I've made sure these little robots won't bump into each other, so they won't be in the same square at the same time.

Want to try it out yourself? You can change things like the number of robots, the size of the grid, how long it takes to clean a square, and where the robots start. It's like a fun playground for you to experiment with. Give our Robot Vacuum Simulator a spin and see what happens!

### Why this project?

During my studies in Master of Applied Science in Software Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland, I encountered an assignment question by Professor Reza Shahidi related to my MASC course. Although this solution is not an exact match, it shares similarities with the question. Instead of providing a solution on standard console, I saw an opportunity to make it more engaging by creating a visual solution.

This was also the perfect opportunity for me to dive into the world of React, a technology I had been eager to learn. I decided to write a code solution, implement it on a web platform, and, in the process, acquire valuable React skills. This experience not only helped me address the assignment effectively but also allowed me to expand my knowledge in a practical and hands-on way.

### Website

You can view the project in [Website](http://robot-simulator.prabinkumarshrestha.com/)

## Installation

To get started with the Robot Vacuum Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabinKshrestha/robot-vacuum-simulator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd robot-vacuum-simulator
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## How to Run the Project

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the Robot Vacuum Simulator in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Details

The problem statement (_Shahidi, R. (2023). Advance Concurrent Programming [Course assignment]. Memorial University of Newfoundland._) can be seen here [Website](http://robot-simulator.prabinkumarshrestha.com/). The instructions is to use configuration files for robots related configs, but instead, I employed form inputs to customize the settings for our vacuum robot simulation. As mentioned earlier, this approach allows us to not only visualize the movements of our robots but also observe any collisions that may occur.

### Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered web applications.
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling the application.
- Tailwind CSS: CSS framework for east styling the application.
- JavaScript for interactivity and logic implementation.

## Attribution

I want to show my gratidute to Professor Reza Shahidi for allowing me to showcase this project.
